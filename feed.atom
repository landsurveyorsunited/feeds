I've just bought an old Sokkisha TS20 theodolite, and I realize that the attachment screw size is not the usual 5/8", but much bigger, somewhere around 1 3/8" (I measured about 34 mm). Does anybody know if there's a tripod with that size of screw, or if adapters from 5/8" to 1 3/8" exist?
Thanks to everyone.
Attached I put 2 pictures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Surveyors,
 
We all are aware that surveying in the Civil Engineering field is becoming a necessity nowadays for Mortgage surveys, Site planning surveys, Topographic surveys, Land surveys, Marine surveys etc.
 
I would like to understand the field surveying process which can help to discuss the current surveying obstacles that the field crew and respective team faces.
 
As the field crew works on site under different conditions leading to errors and incomplete data such as missing point data, unclear sketches, Human errors etc.
 
Please fill up this <Survey_Form> and let me know if you have any suggestions on this topic. I will inform all of you about the survey results as soon as they are ready!
 
Let’s work together to share our thoughts and understand the field surveyors' problems! 
 
Thank you in advance for your valuable insights. I appreciate your trust!!.]]></summary>

I am a budding surveying professional and am trying to troubleshoot my old Nikon DTM A20lg total station. Currently riding the struggle bus as the original manual is pretty slim and not comprehensive. Most of my work is in water resource sciences, performing topographic and bathymetric surveys for river engineeirng projects.
 
I'm only trying to use this (old, inexpensive) TS for simple local surveys in very rugged, WET, accident prone locations, thus why I have gone with the obsolete, vintage tool. I do not have a data collector. Really just trying to get local coordinates and topographic survey scratched into a notepad and put into CAD/HEC.
I have poured through the manual and have figured out how to reset the horizontal reference angle (zenith) to 0 degrees for a local survey and s…]]></summary>
