          "description": "Hi, \nI've just bought an old Sokkisha TS20 theodolite, and I realize that the attachment screw size is not the usual 5/8\", but much bigger, somewhere around 1 3/8\" (I measured about 34 mm). Does anybody know if there's a tripod with that size of screw, or if adapters from 5/8\" to 1 3/8\" exist?\nThanks to everyone.\nAttached I put 2 pictures.\nMirko",

Currently riding the struggle bus as the original manual is pretty slim and not comprehensive. Most of my work is in water resource sciences, performing topographic and bathymetric surveys for river engineeirng projects.\n \nI'm only trying to use this (old, inexpensive) TS for simple local surveys in very rugged, WET, accident prone locations, thus why I have gone with the obsolete, vintage tool.

I will inform all of you about the survey results as soon as they are ready!\n \nLet’s work together to share our thoughts and understand the field surveyors' problems! \n \nThank you in advance for your valuable insights. I appreciate your trust!!.",
