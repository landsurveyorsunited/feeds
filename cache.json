Does anybody know if there's a tripod with that size of screw, or if adapters from 5/8\" to 1 3/8\" exist?\nThanks to everyone.\nAttached I put 2 pictures.\nMirko",

Currently riding the struggle bus as the original manual is pretty slim and not comprehensive. Most of my work is in water resource sciences, performing topographic and bathymetric surveys for river engineeirng projects.\n \nI'm only trying to use this (old, inexpensive) TS for simple local surveys in very rugged, WET, accident prone locations, thus why I have gone with the obsolete, vintage tool. I do not have a data collector. Really just trying to get local coordinates and topographic survey scratched into a notepad and put into CAD/HEC.\nI have poured through the manual and have figured out how to reset the horizontal reference angle (zenith) to 0 degrees for a local survey and s…",
