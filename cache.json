What are the requirements to being a Chartered/Licensed/Registered Surveyor in countries of the European Union? Are there vast differences in requirements between the different countries? Is it easy to transfer credentials and registration between the countries? What are the responsibilites of being a Charted Land Surveyor? What are the responsibilites of being a non-chartered surveyor? \n\n Thank you,\nIP",
