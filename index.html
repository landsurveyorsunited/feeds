                              <span>Hey guys,

Over the years, I have accumulated a couple of Leica 1100 series instruments that have broken down in various ways. Rather than throw them out or sell them for parts, I have tried &quot;mixing and matching&quot; boards from those various instruments. Unfortunately, each instrument simply &quot;doesn&#x27;t see&quot; the board from another instrument. Strangely, it seems to only happen with the numbered boards. I&#x27;m guessing there is something in the mainboard that says &quot;Nope. You have the wrong number. I&#x27;m not allowed to talk to you.&quot;
Are there any gurus out there that have experience with this? Or a workaround? My local dealer refuses to open 1100s anymore, so I am on my own here.
It&#x27;s not the end of the world, I just don&#x27;t see why I should throw this stuff out.

Thanks,

Mick.</span>

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
I am Chris from Avian Australia and I would like to share one of my land surveying projects with you all. We can all do so as part of this thread and share in brief the key challenges or about the gear used by you for the specific project.
In this example we review the benefits of using Avian Australia for aerial surveying and mapping of a 83ha site area.
By partnering with Avian Australia, quarries and construction aggregates suppliers are able to confidently rely on our surveying and volume calculations to assist with stock visibility and improve financial management.
The client required a feature survey (contours), site map and volumetric calculations of various site features including stockpiles, unmined areas and mined areas. This information was delivered in a comprehensive report for the client. Our process was first to set and observe our survey control using the nearest CORS base station for RTK positioning. These points are set on the ground and measured to give local coordinate values within +/- 20mm.

I use Trimble Data transfer (free) software for downloading and uploading to Nikon TS.
W.r.t to a Stonex Total Station. Can I use this software or any other free software. I have not got the Stonex software CD anymore
