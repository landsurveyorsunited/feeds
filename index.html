                              <span>I&#x27;ve got the old Sokkia NET2 Monmos (new Topcon MS1AXII) to hook up to a RS232 port.
Does anyone have a cable (DOC210) or a connector or the description of the female hirose connector that fits underneath?
All info is highly appreciated.
Thanks,
Arjen</span>
