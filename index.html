                              <span>I am on a job site where I am building a facility.
I have to layout pile, anchor bolt and check the pipe rack column to see if is vertical.
Is someone can tell me what will be the best procedure using Trimble Vx Robotic Total Station on the field to check column verticality and produce a QA/QC report  showing the deviation (mm)?
I never done this before (producing a QA/QC report  showing the deviation or Tilt calculation) Is someone can help me on that?
Thank&#x27;s in advance</span>
