                              <span>Hi Surveyors,
 
We all are aware that surveying in the Civil Engineering field is becoming a necessity nowadays for Mortgage surveys, Site planning surveys, Topographic surveys, Land surveys, Marine surveys etc.
 
I would like to understand the field surveying process which can help to discuss the current surveying obstacles that the field crew and respective team faces.
 
As the field crew works on site under different conditions leading to errors and incomplete data such as missing point data, unclear sketches, Human errors etc.
 
Please fill up this  and let me know if you have any suggestions on this topic. I will inform all of you about the survey results as soon as they are ready!
 
Let’s work together to share our thoughts and understand the field surveyors&#x27; problems! 
 
Thank you in advance for your valuable insights. I appreciate your trust!!.</span>

                              <span>Hi Surveyors,
 
We all are aware that surveying in the Civil Engineering field is becoming a necessity nowadays for Mortgage surveys, Site planning surveys, Topographic surveys, Land surveys, Marine surveys etc.
 
I would like to understand the field surveying process which can help to discuss the current surveying obstacles that the field crew and respective team faces.
 
As the field crew works on site under different conditions leading to errors and incomplete data such as missing point data, unclear sketches, Human errors etc.
 
Please fill up this  and let me know if you have any suggestions on this topic. I will inform all of you about the survey results as soon as they are ready!
 
Let’s work together to share our thoughts and understand the field surveyors&#x27; problems! 
 
Thank you in advance for your valuable insights. I appreciate your trust!!.</span>

                              <span>Hello all, New here. I am currently a Registered Land Surveyor in the United States. What are the requirements to being a Chartered/Licensed/Registered Surveyor in countries of the European Union? Are there vast differences in requirements between the different countries? Is it easy to transfer credentials and registration between the countries? What are the responsibilites of being a Charted Land Surveyor? What are the responsibilites of being a non-chartered surveyor? 

 Thank you,
IP</span>
