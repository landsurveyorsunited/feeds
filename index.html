                              <span>Hi, 
I&#x27;ve just bought an old Sokkisha TS20 theodolite, and I realize that the attachment screw size is not the usual 5/8&quot;, but much bigger, somewhere around 1 3/8&quot; (I measured about 34 mm). Does anybody know if there&#x27;s a tripod with that size of screw, or if adapters from 5/8&quot; to 1 3/8&quot; exist?
Thanks to everyone.
Attached I put 2 pictures.
Mirko</span>

                              <span>Hi Surveyors,
 
We all are aware that surveying in the Civil Engineering field is becoming a necessity nowadays for Mortgage surveys, Site planning surveys, Topographic surveys, Land surveys, Marine surveys etc.
 
I would like to understand the field surveying process which can help to discuss the current surveying obstacles that the field crew and respective team faces.
 
As the field crew works on site under different conditions leading to errors and incomplete data such as missing point data, unclear sketches, Human errors etc.
 
Please fill up this  and let me know if you have any suggestions on this topic. I will inform all of you about the survey results as soon as they are ready!
 
Let’s work together to share our thoughts and understand the field surveyors&#x27; problems! 
 
Thank you in advance for your valuable insights. I appreciate your trust!!.</span>
